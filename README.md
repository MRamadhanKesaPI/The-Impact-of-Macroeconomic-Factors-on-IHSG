# The Impact of Macroeconomic Factors on Indonesia Composite Index (IHSG): A Regression Analysis

**Welcome to my personal project repository!**  

## Introduction  

This project explores the impact of exchange rates (EXR) and inflation (INFL) on the Indonesia Composite Index (IHSG) using time-series regression (2010–2024). By analyzing macroeconomic factors, it provides valuable insights for investors and risk analysts to navigate market trends in Indonesia’s emerging economy.

## Key Findings  
- Exchange Rate significantly boosts IHSG performance.  
- Inflation Rate has a negative effect, but its impact is relatively smaller.  
- The model successfully explains 75% of IHSG’s movement with strong statistical significance.  

## Recommendations (Investment & Risk Management Strategies)
-  A stronger IDR lowers business costs and boosts IHSG, while a weaker IDR attracts foreign investment. Use this to time investments wisely. 
-  Balance portfolios during inflation by focusing on commodities, utilities, and consumer staples, as these sectors tend to perform better.
-  Stay informed on macroeconomic trends by tracking central bank policies and global market movements to adjust strategies effectively.
