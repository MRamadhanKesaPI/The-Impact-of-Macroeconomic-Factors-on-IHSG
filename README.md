# The Impact of Macroeconomic Factors on IHSG: A Regression Analysis

## Introduction  
Welcome to my personal project repository!  

This project analyzes the relationship between *Exchange Rate and Inflation Rate* with *The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG)* using regression techniques. By examining macroeconomic factors, this study provides valuable insights for investors and policymakers looking to understand IHSG trends.  

## Key Findings  
- *Exchange Rate significantly boosts* IHSG performance.  
- *Inflation Rate has a negative effect*, but its impact is relatively smaller.  
- The model successfully explains *74.7% of IHSG’s movement* with strong statistical significance.  

## Policy Recommendations  
-  **Support Trade Growth** – The government should encourage exports and maintain balanced trade to boost IHSG.
-  **Control Inflation** – The Central Bank should stabilize inflation through monetary policy to prevent stock market fluctuations.
-  **Strengthen Investor Confidence** – Ensuring economic stability will attract both foreign and domestic investment into IHSG.
